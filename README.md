# plakar - Effortless backup

## Introduction

plakar provides an intuitive, powerful, and scalable backup solution.

Plakar goes beyond file-level backups. It captures application data with its full context.

Data and context are stored using [Kloset](http://localhost:1313/posts/2025-04-29/kloset-the-immutable-data-store/), an open-source, immutable data store that enables the implementation of advanced data protection scenarios.

Plakar's main strengths:
- **Effortless**: Easy to use, clean default. Check out our [quick start guide](https://docs.plakar.io/en/quickstart/).
- **Secure**: Provide audited end-to-end encryption for data and metadata. See our latest [crypto audit report](http://localhost:1313/docs/audits/).
- **Reliable**: Backups are stored in Kloset, an open-source immutable data store. Learn more about [Kloset](http://localhost:1313/posts/2025-04-29/kloset-the-immutable-data-store/).
- **Vertically scalable**: Backup and restore very large datasets with limited RAM usage.
- **Horizontally scalable**: Support high concurrency and multiple backups type in a single Kloset.
- **Browsable**: Browse, sort, search, and compare backups using the Plakar UI.
- **Fast**: backup, check, sync and restore are  operations are optimized for large-scale data.
- **Efficient**: more restore points, less storage, thanks to Kloset's unmatched deduplication and compression.
- **Open Source and actively maintained**: open source forever and now maintained by [Plakar Korp](https://www.plakar.io)

plakar provides useful features:
- **Instant recovery**: Instantly mount large backups on any devices without full restoration.
- **Distributed backup**: Kloset can be easily distributed to implement 3,2,1 rule or advanced strategies (push, pull, sync) across heterogeneous environments.
- **Granular restore**: Restore a complete snapshot or only a subset of your data.
- **Cross-storage restore**: Back up from one storage type (e.g., S3-compatible object store) and restore to another (e.g., file system)..
- **Production safe-guarding**: Automatically adjusts backup speed to avoid impacting production workloads.
- **Lock-free maintenance**: Perform garbage collection without interrupting backup or restore operations.
- **Integrations**: back up and restore from and to any source (file systems, object stores, SaaS applications...) with the right integration.

Simplicity and efficiency are plakar's main priorities.

Our mission is to set a new standard for effortless secure data protection.

## Quickstart

plakar quickstart: https://docs.plakar.io/en/quickstart/

A taste of plakar (please follow the quickstart to begin):
```
$ plakar at /var/backups create                             # Create a repository
$ plakar at /var/backups backup /private/etc                # Backup /private/etc
$ plakar at /var/backups ls                                 # List all repository backup
$ plakar at /var/backups restore -to /tmp/restore 9abc3294  # Restore a backup to /tmp/restore
$ plakar at /var/backups ui                                 # Start the UI
$ plakar at /var/backups sync to @s3                        # Synchronise a backup repository to S3

```
